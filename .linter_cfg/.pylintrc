[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
# PyLint message types:
#         [R]efactor for a “good practice” metric violation
#         [C]onvention for coding standard violation
#         [W]arning for stylistic problems, or minor programming issues
#         [E]rror for important programming issues (i.e. most probably bug)
#         [F]atal for errors which prevented further processing
